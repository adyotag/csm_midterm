Assembly.m, Element.m, and Read_output are the core components of this FEM program. An
"Assembly" contains many "elements".

To run a benchmark for timing, proceed to test.m. Furthermore, an example is 
provided with detailed instructions on how to run.

To run the code that is used in report.pdf, proceed to report.m. This contains sections
arranged by question number and part. The actual report is report.pdf

Finally, if the workspace and files get a bit cluttered, just run "clean" to
invoke clean.m. This is just a basic tool that removes the output files and saved
variables in the folder, and cleans the workspace and command window.
